# Vehicle Intersection Simulation using Advanced Software Engineering

Abstract:
This repository hosts a project in advanced software engineering focused on developing a vehicle simulation application. The project emphasizes iterative development,
threading, design patterns, and agile methods to simulate traffic at a road intersection.

Aim:
The aim of this project was to apply advanced software engineering principles to create a robust vehicle simulation. Key objectives included mastering iterative and agile
methodologies, implementing object-oriented programming practices, and utilizing design patterns effectively.

Languages and Tools:
Language Used: Java
Libraries and Tools: JUnit for unit testing

Requirements and Achievements
Developed a GUI-based application to simulate traffic flow at a road intersection.
Implemented file reading to initialize intersection configuration and vehicle data.
Employed exception handling for data validation and comprehensive unit testing using JUnit.
Applied threading to simulate vehicle movement and synchronized traffic signals for intersection management.
Utilized design patterns such as Singleton, Observer, and MVC to enhance application structure and modularity.
Managed version control to facilitate collaborative development and track project progress.
Generated reports detailing vehicle crossings, waiting times, and emissions.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of advanced software engineering concepts in developing a complex vehicle simulation. By successfully implementing these techniques,
we have gained practical experience that prepares us for future challenges in software engineering.
